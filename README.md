# Introduction
This is the model we created and used for ECON 420, a topics course in machine learning. The model detects and classifies brain tumours.
# Why is this model interesting
1. Very low overfitting as seen by the learning curve
2. High accuracy and a minimised false positive rate for 'No Tumour'. We wanted to include this as it is more important that a model doesn't undiagnose a life threatening abnormality.
